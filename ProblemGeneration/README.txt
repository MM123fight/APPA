You can use command:
	sh make.sh
to downloads real-sim(35M), news20(3.0G), rcv1(6.5G), avazu(34G) files to generate LP problems from SVM problems.
Note: make sure about the enough memory.

The data files generated by make.sh are only for our solver and AL_CD which is referred in our paper.

If you need the mps file, please first use sh make.sh, and then use mpsForm:
1. in mps_form.m: line 3 and line 4 are for setup gurobi in matlab(you can modify it)
                  line 5: go back to the file mpsForm
2. use mps_form('real-sim', data_dir) for example to generate real-sim.mps in dataSet(data_dir should be the aboslute file path of data_dir)

The memory for mps file: 
real-sim.mps(624M)
news20.mps(4.0G)
rcv1.mps(8.5G)
avazu.mps(34G)
Please make sure about the enough memory
